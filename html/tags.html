        HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are used to format text, create links, add images, and more.
        Tags are enclosed in angle brackets <> and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
        For example, <p> is an opening tag and </p> is a closing tag.

    <h2>Semantic vs. Non-Semantic Elements</h2>

    <!-- 
        Semantic elements are HTML elements that have a special meaning. They describe their content to both the browser and the developer.
        Using semantic elements makes your code easier to read and understand. It also helps search engines and screen readers to better understand your content.
    -->
    <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and
      machine-readable way.
    </p>

    <!-- Examples of semantic elements -->
    <header>
      <!-- The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. -->
      <h1>Main Title</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
      <!-- The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links. -->
      <a href="#">Home</a>
      <a href="#">About</a>
      <a href="#">Contact</a>
    </nav>

    <main>
      <!-- The <main> element specifies the main content of a document. -->
      <article>
        <!-- The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. -->
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is an article.</p>
      </article>

      <section>
        <!-- The <section> element defines a section in a document. -->
        <h2>Section Title</h2>
        <p>This is a section.</p>
      </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <!-- The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section. -->
      <p>Copyright &copy; 2025</p>
    </footer>

    <!-- 
        Non-semantic elements are HTML elements that do not have a special meaning. They are used to group content for styling purposes.
        While they are necessary for styling, they don't provide any information about the content.
    -->
    <h3>Non-Semantic Elements</h3>
    <p>Non-semantic elements tell nothing about their content.</p>

    <!-- Examples of non-semantic elements -->
    <div>
      <!-- The <div> element is a block-level container for other HTML elements. It is often used to group elements for styling with CSS. -->
      <p>This is a div.</p>
    </div>

    <span>
      <!-- The <span> element is an inline container for a part of a text. It is often used to apply styles to a part of a text. -->
      This is a span.
    </span>

    <h2>Block vs. Inline Elements</h2>

    <!-- 
        Block-level elements are elements that start on a new line and take up the full width of their container.
        They are used to create large blocks of content, such as paragraphs, headings, and lists.
    -->
    <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width
      available.
    </p>

    <!-- Examples of block-level elements -->
    <div>This is a div.</div>
    <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!-- 
        Inline elements are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
        They are used to format small pieces of content, such as a single word or a link.
    -->
    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Inline elements do not start on a new line and they only take up as much
      width as necessary.
    </p>

    <!-- Examples of inline elements -->
    <span>This is a span.</span>
    <a href="#">This is a link.</a>
    <strong>This is strong text.</strong>
  </body>
</html>
